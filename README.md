Probability Distributions App
=================

An ugly little probability distribution graphing app.

### Requires
- Java 1.8
- Scala 2.10
- sbt

### How to run
`sbt run`

### What is this?
This project contains two things: a little app written using Scala and Swing that plots probability distributions and allows you to twiddle the parameters of those distributions and see how their shape changes, and an app that plots dots on a grid whose background color changes every second. It's greater purpose is a mystery.
